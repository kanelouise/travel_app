This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Access
Access this mobile-first designed travel app at https://travel-app-kane-test.vercel.app/

This app was created based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=cuzw4vL1z5E)JavaScript Mastery tutorial.

## Scope

This app was created using Typescript and the Next.js framework to create a responsive webpage deployed with Vercel. 

Because the goal of this project was deployment, I completed the main section of the website before deploying. With more time, I will complete the other sections of the website, including: Camp, Guide, Features, and Call to Action.

## Running Locally
Run `yarn start` to spin up site at `localhost:3000/`
